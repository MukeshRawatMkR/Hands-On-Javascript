Types of Scopes:
1. Global Scope
2. Function Scope
3. Block Scope

1. Global Scope: refers to the scope where the variable is gonna be accessible from anywhere in the program.
Global Scoped variable are accesible thoghotut in you program , be it a function , loops, if else, anything.
example://to be written
But if we try to access a variable which is defined inside any function or loop, then we can't access it outside, now that vairable is inside the (function scope).
example://to be written


2. Function Scope: means, visiblity of a varaible is only inside the function where variable has been defined, we cant access it outside the fucntion.
example: //to be written

3. Block Scope: wherever we define a pair of curly braces maybe with if-else, loops, etc or may be without anything, it creates something called a block.
Block is a collection of valid JS instruction(s) enclosed in a pair or curly braces.
any variable defined inside a block has a block scope.
example: //to be written

H/W: what's the diff b'w function and block scope parenthesis, both share same block parentheses?

/*
Is the scope of the variable defined only by where is it declared?
No, scope of the variable is also decided by how it is declared. so, how a variable is declared?
using:
 var-> helps us to declare function scope or global scoped variables.
 let -> helps us to initialize block scoped variables.
 const -> helps us to initialize block scoped variables.
and they also help us to define the scope of the variables.
