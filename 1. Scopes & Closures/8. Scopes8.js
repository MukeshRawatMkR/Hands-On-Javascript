//Hoisting is not a concept unique to JavaScript; it exists in other programming languages as well. However, the way it is implemented in JavaScript can lead to some unexpected behavior, especially for those who are new to the language.
// If you know about 2 phase execution of JS, like how JS executes code in two phases: then don't give a damn about hoisting.
//You don't even need to think or search about it(Hoisting).
//there is no Hoisting word defined in official documentation of JavaScript.
