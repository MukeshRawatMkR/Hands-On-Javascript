//Todo -> understand
//All parts of a class's body are strict mode code, including both class declarations and class expressions.

class C1 {
  // All code here is evaluated in strict mode
  test() {
    delete Object.prototype;
  }
}
new C1().test(); // TypeError, because test() is in strict mode

const C2 = class {
  // All code here is evaluated in strict mode
};

// Code here may not be in strict mode
delete Object.prototype; // Will not throw error
