//Changes in strict mode:

/**
 * 
 * Strict mode changes both syntax and runtime behavior. Changes generally fall into these categories:
    changes converting mistakes into errors (as syntax errors or at runtime)
    changes simplifying how variable references are resolved
    changes simplifying eval and arguments
    changes making it easier to write "secure" JavaScript
    changes anticipating future ECMAScript evolution.
