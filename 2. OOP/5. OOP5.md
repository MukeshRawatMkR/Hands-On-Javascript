# IQ: How 'new' keyword works in JS internally?

- Everytime we call new, it does the following 4 step procedure:
- 1. It creates a brand new empty object.
- 2. It calls the constrcutuor of the class and passes the newly created object(not as a parameter)but inside a keyword called as 'this'. so construcotor automatically has access to the this keyword and when we call new, then the this keyword has access to the plain object created in step 1 and constructor now can use the this kwyrod inside it. and then whatever the logic of construcor it is executed.
- 3. in step 3, new triggers everything need to be done for prtotypes to work(will discuss later).
- 4. Now, If from a constrcutor an object is manually returned then this manual returned object is soted in the called variable, otherwise in any other case i.e, either as don't return anything or return something apart from object, construcotr doesn't care about it and retyrb the value inside the keyword.
